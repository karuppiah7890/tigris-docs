# Self-hosting Tigris

Tigris is developed with Kubernetes in mind and is fully containerized. We
expect you to deploy Tigris on Kubernetes in production.

If you are having a hard time installing Tigris yourself, seek help from the
Tigris Community! Consider joining our [Discord](https://discord.tigrisdata.com/)
and seek assistance there!

The following sections will guide you through setting up Tigris in various
cloud environments. You can self-host Tigris anywhere, as long as Kubernetes is
available.
