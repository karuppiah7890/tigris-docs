# Schema

A schema defines all the fields that make up the document in a collection. All documents stored in a collection must conform to the collection's schema

## Schema Validation

The validation happens during the inserts or updates to the collection. The validation performed like this:

<li>Newly inserted documents are checked for validation.</li>
<li>
  During update, the new fields values are checked for the validation. As during
  insertion we are validating the document so we only need to validate the
  input.
</li>

## Modifying the Schema

After creating the collection, you can update the schema at any time. For example, in the previous Catalog model you
need to add a `description` field to store product description. This can be achieve by just calling `createOrUpdateCollection`
with a new model.

### Step 1: Update the Model

Add the new field in your model.

```go
type Catalog struct {
	Id         int `tigris:"primary_key,autoGenerate"`
	Name       string
	Price      float64
	Brand      string
	Labels     string
	Popularity int
	Description string
}
```

### Step 2: Update the Collection

Updates the collection with the new model and any new operation will see the changes.

```go
db, err := client.OpenDatabase(ctx, "catalogdb", &Catalog{})
```
