Tigris provides powerful query functionality for specifying which documents you want to retrieve. There is no need to
index any field as Tigris allows querying on any field of a document.

## Filter

Filter provides the following comparison operators with the same semantics as in virtually all programming languages.

- <b>{props.filters["eq"]}</b>: equal to is used for exact matching.
- <b>{props.filters["lt"]}</b>: less than is used for matching documents using
  less than criteria.
- <b>{props.filters["lte"]}</b>: less than or equal to is similar to <b>
    {props.filters["lt"]}
  </b> but also matches for equality.
- <b>{props.filters["gt"]}</b>: greater than is used for matching documents
  using greater than criteria.
- <b>{props.filters["gte"]}</b>: greater than or equal to is similar to <b>
    {props.filters["gt"]}
  </b> but also matches for equality.

For multiple conditions, there are two logical operators supported.

- <b>{props.filters["or"]}</b>: Combines multiple filter operators and returns
  documents when either condition is met.
- <b>{props.filters["and"]}</b>: Combines multiple filter operators and returns
  documents when all the conditions are met.

## Sort

You can also [apply a sort](#sorting) to the query results by specifying the field to sort and the sort order:

- <b>{props.sortDirection.ASC}</b>: Sort ascending
- <b>{props.sortDirection.DESC}</b>: Sort decending

## Example Collection

The first step is to create the collection object.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.createCollection}
  asyncExample={props.asyncCreateCollection}
/>

Assuming an e-commerce website that has the above collection catalog and has 5 products(documents) in it.

| id  | name           | price | brand        | labels   | popularity | reviews                             |
| --- | -------------- | ----- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1   | fiona handbag  | 99.9  | michael kors | purses   | 8          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 7}    |
| 2   | tote bag       | 49    | coach        | handbags | 9          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.3} |
| 3   | sling bag      | 75    | coach        | purses   | 9          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 9.2}  |
| 4   | sneakers shoes | 40    | adidas       | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 9}   |
| 5   | running shoes  | 89    | nike         | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.5} |

## Simple read query

A straightforward query is to read document by applying a filter on a field. As an example, using filter
in above collection to get a product where `brand = "adidas"`

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.readOne}
  asyncExample={props.asyncReadOne}
/>

Above query would return a single document matching the filter. To read multiple documents:

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.readMany}
  asyncExample={props.asyncReadMany}
/>

Or to read all documents from the collection:

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.readAll}
  asyncExample={props.asyncReadAll}
/>

:::tip
By default, string comparison is **case-sensitive**. To learn, how to make **case-insensitive** queries,
see the [case-insensitive queries section](#case-insensitive-queries).
:::

<CursorFundamentalsBox codeLang={props.codeLang} />

## Filtering on multiple fields

Single field filtering is useful but what if you need to also filter by `price`. Following is an example where we are
reading all the products where `brand = "adidas"` and `price < 50`

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.multipleFields}
  asyncExample={props.asyncMultipleFields}
/>

## Reading specific fields

Instead of reading all the fields of a document, fields projection allows reading specific fields. As an above example,
let's say you only need to read `name`, `price` and `brand` fields from a document.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.readFields}</CodeBlock>

:::caution
Users can either specify `include` fields or `exclude` fields, but not both.
:::

## Applying range conditions

Many times the need for filtering is based on range on a numeric field. A range can be applied to any numeric field and
in fact multiple numeric fields can be part of a single filter. Letâ€™s take an example of reading all the products that
are `price` less than 50 and have a `popularity` score of greater than or equal to 8.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.rangeRead}</CodeBlock>

### Querying by metadata

Tigris automatically generates following metadata fields for the document:

- **created_at:** Time when this document was added to database.
- **updated_at:** Time when this document was last modified. This field is only generated once an existing document is modified.

These generated fields are queryable by user. For example, to fetch documents inserted within a 24 hour period:

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.metadataFilter}</CodeBlock>

## Applying multiple logical filters

Even after applying multiple AND conditions, what if you need something even more complex? What about reading documents
where we need a logical `OR` on `brand` but also need to apply logical `AND` on some other fields. Let's read products where the
`brand` is either "adidas" or "coach" but the `price` should be less than 50 and the product should be `popular`.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.logicalFilters}</CodeBlock>

## Querying nested fields

As we can see all the above examples are for top level fields but what if you have an object, and you want to filter
documents based on one of the nested field. Taking the above data, if you want to get all the products which have `labels`
set as "shoes" but should have `rating` greater than 7.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.nestedFields}</CodeBlock>

## Case-insensitive queries

By default, all String comparisons are **case-sensitive**. However, if you need to ignore the case
then set the case to `ci` in the collation object. The following example demonstrates a **case-insensitive**
query for `brand` "Adidas"

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.readUsingCollation}</CodeBlock>

Above query will match terms `["adidas", "aDiDas", "Adidas", "adiDas"]` etc.

## Sorting query results {#sorting}

Results are order by X by default. However, you can specify the field the results are to be sorted on and the order in which they are sorted.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.sortResults}</CodeBlock>
