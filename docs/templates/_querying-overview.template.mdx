## Specification

```shell
{
  "fields": {
    <field1>: 1|0,
    <field2>: 1|0,
  },
  "filter": {
    <field1>: number|string|boolean,
    <field2>: {<$lt|$lte|$gt|$gte>: number},
    <$and|$or>: [<field3>: number|string|boolean, expr1, expr2...]
  },
  "options": {
    "limit": number
  }
}
```

Understanding the syntax:

- The `fields` projection allows you to specify which field to include by setting it to 1 or exclude it by setting it to 0. By default, all the fields are returned in the response.
- The `filter` syntax is documented in the following section.
- The `options` allows you to paginate the result.

### Filter specification

Deep diving into the JSON representation of the filter

```shell
{
  "filter": {
    <field1>: number|string|boolean,
    <field2>: {<$lt|$lte|$gt|$gte>: number},
    <$and|$or>: [<field3>: number|string|boolean, expr1, expr2...]
  }
}
```

- On the left either you can have a field name or you can specify a logical operator. On the right, either you can have a value or an expression.
- An `expr` inside logical operator can be a simple condition, or multiple conditions combined using nested logical operators.
- For `$eq`: a matching value can be of type numeric, string or boolean.
- For `$lt, $lte, $gt, $gte`: only numeric values are allowed.

:::note
Observe that when no comparison operator is passed then `$eq` is assumed. Similarly, unless explicitly provided `$and` is assumed on the top level conditions.
