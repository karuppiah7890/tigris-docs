To insert one or more documents in Tigris, you can use Insert or Replace API.

<div>{props.loadOverview && <InsertSpecs />}</div>

### Example collection

The first step is to set up the collection object. All the operations on
the collection are performed through this collection object.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.createCollection}
  asyncExample={props.asyncCreateCollection}
/>

## Insert a Single Document

Insert API can be used to insert one or more documents into the collection. Since the `id` field
is marked as **autoGenerate**, you don't need to specify a value for it and Tigris will automatically generate it for you.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.simpleInsert}
  asyncExample={props.asyncSimpleInsert}
/>

The insert API maintains the uniqueness of the field marked as the primary key, for example, the field `id` in the
example above. If the document with the same primary key value already exists in the collection, the operation will fail
by throwing an HTTP status code **409** with the message <i>"duplicate key value, violates key constraint"</i>

## Insert Multiple Documents

Similar, to a single row insert, you can also insert multiple documents by passing an array of documents.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.batchInsert}</CodeBlock>

## Upsert a Single Document

Insert or replace operation can be used to insert a new document or replace an existing document with the same
primary key value. This API is useful when there is no need for a uniqueness check on the primary key, and it is fine
to replace documents that already exist. The following is an example when the row with an `id` **3** already exists
so the below operation will replace the document with the newly provided data.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.simpleUpsert}
  asyncExample={props.asyncSimpleUpsert}
/>

## Upsert Multiple Documents

As the API can also be used when the document doesn't exist. The following is an example of when these two
documents are inserted because there are no corresponding ids.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.batchUpsert}</CodeBlock>
